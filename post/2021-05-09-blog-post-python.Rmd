The ongoing debate about R versus Python is mostly a statistics versus CS/ML debate. Some argue that R syntax is a bit clunkier, while Python syntax is slightly sleeker. Or that R runs slower and Python runs faster. Although this may be true, the Reticulate package allows R and Python to interact together!

Firstly, the Reticulate package must be loaded in R. Next, assign a name to an object.
```{R}
library(reticulate)

versus <- "Python loves"
```

Next, the same thing must be done, however this time in a Python code chunk. The print function could be used to obtain the objects from the R code chunk.
```{python}
versus = "R Studio!"
print(r.versus, versus)
```
